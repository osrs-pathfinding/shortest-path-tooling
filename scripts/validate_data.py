"""Deterministic data-validation checks for committed plugin data.

Inputs (all read-only):
- committed submodule TSVs, enumerated via
  ``git -C shortest-path ls-files src/main/resources`` — never a
  filesystem glob, so gitignored scratch can never leak into a check
- curated league-region bboxes at src/test/resources/leagues_regions.tsv
- the committed collision-map.zip

Outputs: ``file:line`` findings on stdout, a ``Summary:`` trailer, and
an exit code that is nonzero only when a ran hard check produced
findings — advisory checks report but never move the exit code.

Run standalone::
